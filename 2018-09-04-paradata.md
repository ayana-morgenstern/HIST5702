# *Canada: Shedding Light on the (un)Official Narrative*:
## Paradata

The process of creating the project I have chosen to title Canada: Shedding Light on the (un)Official Narrative has been one of compromise and uncertainty, a process that surely mimics the creation of any narrative that purports to be 'truth'. However, I hope that the serious thought and doubts that this project has birthed is reflected in the final product and the nuanced narrative it attempts to portray. I like to think that I have given much more thought to my narrative and its implications than the Canadian Heritage officials that put together the Northern Lights Sound and Light Show. Although a feat of engineering and visually pleasing, these qualities are clearly used to subdue its role in replicating and normalizing many nationalist narratives that paint Canada as a nation void of precolonial history, and with a settler colonial narrative that is viewed as natural with a dash of utopianism. 
	From the onset of beginning this 'Guerrilla History' class, I knew that I wanted to tell a narrative that engaged with marginalized communities and experiences. Originally, I wanted to do something involving sound: I felt that this sense was very emotionally salient and would provoke a strong engagement on the part of the viewer/player. I liked the idea of creating some sort of location-based soundscape, possibly with the use of ARIS. However, my first idea of mapping or soundscaping/soundmapping discourses of domestic or gendered violence proved too ambitious and fraught for the scope of this class. Firstly, I would have run into the problem of ethics because the only way to truly create an authentic and non-performative representation of this violence would have been to give victims voices. This would have required clearance, and although a process and project that I am perhaps interested in pursuing in the future, it simply proved impossible this time around. I also was intrigued by mapping out locations of significance to the LGBTQ community in Centretown's 'The Village' neighbourhood. However, the Bank Street BIA has created a webpage through their Village Legacy Project that essentially does this, and although the idea of creating a sort of location-based game that included sound and engaged with this information was interesting, I did not feel that it was particularly subversive or revolutionary enough. I wanted something that I felt provided more emotional involvement. 
	Based on my own interest in Canadian literature in my academic – and particularly graduate – career, I decided it would be helpful to engage with something I was personally knowledgeable and interested in. My recent research has focused on indigenous citizenship rights, as well as epistemological mismatches and various Canadian writers' attempts to bridge these gaps, and I have also developed an interest in ghosts as spaces of healing and indigenous resurgence. All this to say that I decided that the idea of working with official national narratives to be a good starting point. I also wanted to use my knowledge of notions of indigenous citizenship and the importance of acknowledging trauma to healing – and its interesting connection to ghosts in Canadian literary tradition – to reflect on how the (un)Official narrative could be improved. From ghosts I thought of light and 'shedding light' onto the truth and how this could be used in terms of the form reflecting my desired content.  I also decided to directly engage with some work I had read in my academic career and something that I had experienced in person, such as the Northern Lights show. I thought it would be subversive and powerful to literally deform and deconstruct the official narrative that accompanies the Parliamentary light show and to do it through the same medium – that of projection mapping. 
	Shawn then suggested that I look into Lisa Daly's a-physical-book repository, which essentially gives text mass and gravity, and manipulates the text based on different effects. After much poring through Daly's repositories I realized that the simplest way to actually apply the desired effect to my text was to simply use her live demo version. Actually modifying the code to create my own PDF did not seem the best way to go about it, especially with the need to have the text actually be a video. Also the code was very intimidating and lengthy since she converted such a massive corpus, and I felt too intimidated to attempt to wade through it and figure out where my data needed to go. From then on, Shawn recommended finding a way to record my laptop screen and splicing them together to create the files needed for my projection mapping project. I paid for the pro version of Screen-cast-omatic which not only allowed me to record the screen as I fed my text through the live demo, it also allowed me to easily edit, crop, and change the speed of the video to suit my needs. However, I had decided that I wanted the 'alternative' narrative to be a 'reconstruction' of the problematic national narrative, which meant I had to figure out how to reverse some of my video clips. I used iMovie to reverse those chosen clips, and then imported the clips as 'paints' into MapMap. By switching the different paints' visibility, I am able to create a sort of performance where the clips just need to  be cycled through. I wanted to project it on Dunton Tower, but weather and the cold made that challenging. I have decided that once the snow on my balcony is melted, I am going to use my own projector to do some impromptu projections of this project, and would like to record those and eventually place the videos on my Github blog. 
	I debated about creating a website for the project, but I am less worried about documentation and permanence than I am about embracing the ephemeral nature of projection mapping. I like the idea of doing multiple spontaneous projections over the spring and summer months because I feel like this is more subversive and 'guerrilla'. As a project evidently concerned with the truth attached to the written word, I feel that committing the project in its entirety might be counter to the aims of the project itself. However, it is something that I am open to, and I do like that this project is something that can be sustained and also encourage new digital work alongside it. I really loved playing with the permanence of the written word, choosing to deform 'stable' and unchallenged narratives, making them ephemeral, and again using light to represent a new 'truth'. I believe that true national pride does not entail an effacement of what can be perceived as negative; instead, we have to accept that Canada has ghosts, and that until these ghosts are acknowledged, true healing and reconciliation cannot take place. I also wanted to show people unpleasant narratives that they – as well as myself until recently – might not even realize exist. 
	If anything, this course and project has taught me that digital work is challenging, yet achievable. Because of this, I feel more prepared to tackle some of the more 'ambitious' projects I had had in mind. I am also very excited to pursue further digital work, particularly with the notion of 'guerrilla' history/narratives in mind. I think it would be great to create a location-based game that blends sound and subversive narratives about gendered violence and hate crimes in Canada. I also really like the idea of sonifying coordinates of some kind and creating a sort of sonic map that narrativizes a theme I am interested in. I am also very interested in the idea of creating story-maps and how those can be used to tell narratives and blend hybrid media like maps with images and text.
