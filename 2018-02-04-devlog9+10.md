# Devlog 9 and 10

I feel like I somehow squeezed two weeks into a single devlog, meaning that I somehow still have 2 left to do: for this purpose I am simply going to combine this week's remarks to make up these last 2 logs. Oh well.
I have been thinking about filming the projection and need to organize the performance aspect of it: it will have to be done at dusk I am assuming for maximum visibility, and I'd like to be able to do it sometime in the next week. We shall see. I like the idea of filming it because then if I choose to create a website for permanence I have the option. Realistically, I have the project on my computer and I could do some of my own guerilla projecting if I really want to over the summer: I kind of like the idea of just running around randomly projecting it without warning and then disappearing off into the night. I have also been inspired to look more into sonification and maybe creating some sort of cool soundscape map in my own time. Just things to think about.
