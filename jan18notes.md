_**Idea for project: location-based soundcape of homophobic/sexual violence in Ottawa's "The village".**_ 

https://mapmapteam.github.io

- idea of secure connections/file sharing
- idea of how these reflect underpinnings/power dynamics of the techs we use. 

*how do we design to reflect feminist digital history leanings/goals?* 

everytime you categorize something you close down a lot of possibilities/interpretations. creating databases can shut thigns down. 
how do you persuade people to connect?:
- have a narrative
- have a participatory element
- password based: make someone fight for access. 
- scavenger hunt
- physical present/item to signal
- rewrite the purpose of the space (what purpose of a space cannot be touched/changed and why?)
- politics of labour: openness of academic knowledge: idea of accessibility/collaboration. 

**We have no budget!!** Work within constraints. 

- How do we design a digital intervention? Do we need the idea first or the framework first?
*Design Thinking*: comes out of business. 
- Brainstorm
- Build stuff
- See if works
- Start over if it doesn't work

**Inspiration --> Ideation --> Implementation (TRIANGLE)** 
Not a sequential process: cyclical, working between having ideas and implementing them. 

- Soundscape
- Ottawa's Chinatown relocation. Map where the Chinatown used to be. 
- Reframing Gay history in Ottawa: pushing it to the forefront. 
- History of Imperial Theatre transforming into Barrymore's and role in counterculture music
- Mess with perception of time/linear time

- try and find soundscape from the past: you can hear what the city would have been like. 

-Recho (location based sound)
- sound of the dead in touristy spots *hidden dead of ottawa*
- tunnels of ottawa. secret buried train. 
- what triggers it? how do they interact with it? incentive?
- ottawa in the 1920s.
