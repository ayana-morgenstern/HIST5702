_**Idea for project: location-based soundcape of homophobic/sexual violence in Ottawa's "The village".**_

- idea of secure connections/file sharing
- idea of how these reflect underpinnings/power dynamics of the techs we use. 

*how do we design to reflect feminist digital history leanings/goals?* 

everytime you categorize something you close down a lot of possibilities/interpretations. creating databases can shut thigns down. 
how do you persuade people to connect?:
- have a narrative
- have a participatory element
- password based: make someone fight for access. 
- scavenger hunt
- physical present/item to signal
- rewrite the purpose of the space (what purpose of a space cannot be touched/changed and why?)
