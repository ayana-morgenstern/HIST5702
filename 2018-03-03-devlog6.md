# Devlog 6

I'm on a roll I feel! **Screen-cast-omatic** is allowing me to record my screen while I put my **now** larger chunks of text (which I feel more confident about honestly) through a-physical-book and since I got the Pro version I can edit the video, slowing it down, cropping it as needed, and hopefully the current recordings I have created will be able to be read easily (also thinking of looping the video a couple times when I project it (maybe doing like a 20 min installation or something?), because may as well make sure it can be watched through by many people) because I am concerned that my familiarity with it makes me read it really quickly. I have yet to totally figure out how to reverse the ones that need to be reversed, but I figure I will do that once all my recordings are made. I am also thinking of projecting the panels side by side, having some sort of fade between them to make it look more seamless/dynamic.
I have also figured out how to reverse videos in iMovie, and now it is just a matter of positioning and queuing up the clips into mapmap.

I have been playing around on MapMap, and decided which panels on DT I want to project on. 

I have been playing with Twine for Brian's literature and DH course where I plan on creating an interactive story/essay: It is a lot of work and a lot of steps to figure out all the storyboarding and links. But it is very exciting!

I've also been thinking a lot about non-linear narratives and the primacy of the written word in literature and history, and how fun and engaged I am at the prospect of playing with this notion/trying to change a linear-centric notion of narrative.
