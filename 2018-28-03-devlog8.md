# Devlog 8

Still have to practice MapMapping stuff on my computer/two screens. Apparently we may not get to actually project our work because of admin stuff and release forms... wah. 
Many questions still about if my computer will be able to process the whole performance in a streamlined/not glitchy manner. 
Status: pretty much done other than doing the actual "performance". 
No need for waivers! Yay!
Going to see if I can embed the video files into my github/blog.

Fabrica: using an old factory as a piece of public art/public history. 
- Imaginary Soundscapes: mashes image recognition with sound samples. 

Things I've learned: 
1. That a lot of digital work is invisible.
2. That the form of your project can reflect the content in really interesting manners
3. That there is a lot of thinking to do about what you want to say and how you want to say it
4. A lot of digital work is trial and error/playing around/experiementing. 
5. Digital work is often waaay more labour intensive than we think!
