## Digital Public History:
Use the digital to reach people in a different way and create a piece of public history.
*You don't need permission!* 
Try and confound notions of what digital history could be.
*Can do sound/game/light based projects*

*The world is thick with digital data* :
- IE: Wifi networks on your phone. 

**Historical Friction**:
WE FINALLY GOT TO SEE SHAWNS WIKIPEDIA PROJECT IN ACTION. Cacaphony (digital data) shouting at us and changing the way we interact with space/history. *The space is annotated digitally and makes it more difficult to move through* Experience the physicality of digital data. 
*All of Shawn's notes/slides are on his GITHUB*

## What is Digital History?
- Digital HIstory as it is versus as it could be 
- Core Concepts
- Weekly Flow
- Your Responsibilities, Your Rewards
- Ottawa as a canvas for Guerilla Digital Public History (Projection Mapping, Pirate Boxes, Place-based storytelling).
