## Digital Public History:
Use the digital to reach people in a different way and create a piece of public history.
*You don't need permission!* 
Try and confound notions of what digital history could be.
*Can do sound/game/light based projects*

*The world is thick with digital data* :
- IE: Wifi networks on your phone. 

**Historical Friction**:
WE FINALLY GOT TO SEE SHAWNS WIKIPEDIA PROJECT IN ACTION. Cacaphony (digital data) shouting at us and changing the way we interact with space/history. *The space is annotated digitally and makes it more difficult to move through* Experience the physicality of digital data. 
*All of Shawn's notes/slides are on his GITHUB*

## What is Digital History?
- Digital HIstory as it is versus as it could be 
- Core Concepts
- Weekly Flow
- Your Responsibilities, Your Rewards
- Ottawa as a canvas for Guerilla Digital Public History (Projection Mapping, Pirate Boxes, Place-based storytelling).

**LOOK AT PROGRAM HISTORIAN AGAIN** DIGITAL STUFF FOR RESEARCH. 

## Core Concepts:
- Digital history is about making things
- The point of making is about discovery, not justification
- Through making we come to understand the issue deeply, differently. divergently
- making might let us find again the web we lost, the web we have to save.
- the digital world overlays and interwines the physical world
- this engagenement can involve using digital toold, platforms, and data against the ways that the hegemons desire, it is political
- because it is political it involves an element of danger
- the weapons of guerilla history might be truth and beauty bombs.

## The syllabus:
- documenting process/what you think/what you read
- Weekly pattern: collaborative reading with hypothesis, making, breaking and experimenting in class and out. devlog/open notebook on Github.
- Must push. Must document. Must read/ Must make noise. Go against the grain (digital tech requires submission, push back!) Tell histories that are not amenable to middle aged white guys on the internet. 
- Assessment: oral reports (talking about project), 10 devlogs, Project (paradata and the thing itself).
