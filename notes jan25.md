# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes. 
Projecting a history of artist interventions?
*Idea of anonymity* What affordances does this bring?
- Projection mapping of MMIW
- Idea of truth decay: use as much gravitas possible to intervene in truth decay?

- Urban church involved in 60s scoop!!!!!! 
- I like the idea of pushing boundaries and engaging in confrontation: make people uncomfortable. Figure out different affordances. 
- **PLAY WITH THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS TEXT** Explode the text, rewrite it. 

We're gonna build something in Aris! [Aris](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/)

- You could do a neighbourhood tour?
- Plaques are way points in the story. I WANNA BUILD A STORY FOR SURE!

- Tool to plan out what should happen: Twinery. 

- Could do a walking tour of the "gay scene": explore it chronologically/element of having to stay hidden?
