# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.
