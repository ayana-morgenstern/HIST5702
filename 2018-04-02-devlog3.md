## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*
**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*
**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 
Two Row Wampum:  From the standpoint of the Haudenosaunee, the kaswentha relationship embodies one of interdependence: the two parties to the agreement may share the same space while retaining, as Anishinaabe political theorist Dale Turner has pointed out, their status as “distinct political entities”. Put another way, kaswentha makes manifest the joint decision by two parties to remain independent together.

*In the War of 1812, English and French speaking farmers in Upper and Lower Canada took up arms alongside British regulars. Hundreds of black men, who had fled north to escape slavery, fought the American invasions of the Canadas. Ten thousand First Nations warriors helped seal the victory.*
**First Nations contribution to war as allies not as subjects: what they expected in return**
First Nations and Métis communities sided with the British during the war because they shared a common goal: to resist American expansion. [Source](https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1338906261900/1338906300039)
Manifest Destiny was a belief that expansion Westward was natural. The push westward took the most drastic toll on Indigenous peoples of areas affected by these mutual expansionist tendencies, who experienced forced dislocation and long ranging negative effects of the imposition of foreign models of governance over their political sovereignty.

*Canada has always meant land. It has meant strength, freedom and pride of place under great northern skies.*
**Quote about indigenous tie to land:landed citizenship**

citizens; Canada and its citizens have to acknowledge their Aboriginal foundation. (Sui Generis Youngblood Henderson)

*A modern nation rooted in collaboration emerged, from sea, to sea, to sea. Canada.*

*There is something in the Canadian spirit which craves a quest.*
*Quests are real and imagined voyages of discovery.*
**Quests for belonging on part of immigrants? (Maybe a quote by Anna Jameson/Catherine Parr Traill)** 

*We tied Canada together with two ribbons of steel.*
**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 
The difficulty in obtaining an adequate work force in British Columbia led to the controversial importation of thousands of Chinese workers. Around 15,000 Chinese labourers helped to build the Canadian Pacific Railway — working in harsh conditions for little pay, they suffered greatly and historians estimate that at least 600 died.[Source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-pacific-railway/)
