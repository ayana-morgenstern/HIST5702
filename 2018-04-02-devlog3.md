# Devlog #3

This week: (in class) figure out how to use the a-physical-book, json stuff. Going to finalize transcript for presentation/performance. 

How we are encountering the digital/changing our perspective of public history? Narrative. Developing digital skills. Changing the way in which information is delivered to the public: interest in public facing academia. Interest in Canadian history/identity and narrative. 
## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*

**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*

**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

Two Row Wampum:  From the standpoint of the Haudenosaunee, the kaswentha relationship embodies one of interdependence: the two parties to the agreement may share the same space while retaining, as Anishinaabe political theorist Dale Turner has pointed out, their status as “distinct political entities”. Put another way, kaswentha makes manifest the joint decision by two parties to remain independent together.

“The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the Dominion as speedily as they are fit to change.”
– John A Macdonald, 1887 [Source](http://indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca/the_indian_act/)

*French culture flourished all across Canada.*

**Something about French discrimination?**

In 1912, the Ontario government attempted to force the assimilation of Franco-Ontarians by banning French language in francophone schools. [Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/rachel-decoste/most-discriminatory-canadian-laws_b_3932297.html)

*In the War of 1812, English and French speaking farmers in Upper and Lower Canada took up arms alongside British regulars. Hundreds of black men, who had fled north to escape slavery, fought the American invasions of the Canadas. Ten thousand First Nations warriors helped seal the victory.*

**First Nations contribution to war as allies not as subjects: what they expected in return**

First Nations and Métis communities sided with the British during the war because they shared a common goal: to resist American expansion. [Source](https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1338906261900/1338906300039)
Manifest Destiny was a belief that expansion Westward was natural. The push westward took the most drastic toll on Indigenous peoples of areas affected by these mutual expansionist tendencies, who experienced forced dislocation and long ranging negative effects of the imposition of foreign models of governance over their political sovereignty.

*Canada has always meant land. It has meant strength, freedom and pride of place under great northern skies.*

**Quote about indigenous tie to land:landed citizenship** 

Aboriginal peoples do not have to join Canada and become
citizens; Canada and its citizens have to acknowledge their Aboriginal foundation. (Sui Generis Youngblood Henderson)

*A modern nation rooted in collaboration emerged, from sea, to sea, to sea. Canada.*

*There is something in the Canadian spirit which craves a quest.*
*Quests are real and imagined voyages of discovery.*

**Quests for belonging on part of immigrants? (Maybe a quote by Anna Jameson/Catherine Parr Traill)** 

*We tied Canada together with two ribbons of steel.*

**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

The difficulty in obtaining an adequate work force in British Columbia led to the controversial importation of thousands of Chinese workers. Around 15,000 Chinese labourers helped to build the Canadian Pacific Railway — working in harsh conditions for little pay, they suffered greatly and historians estimate that at least 600 died.[Source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-pacific-railway/)

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*

**Japanese internment/displacement** 

Just over 90 per cent of Japanese Canadians — some 21,000 people — were uprooted during the war. The majority were Canadian citizens by birth.
In a further betrayal, an order-in-council signed 19 January 1943 liquidated all Japanese property that had been under the government’s “protective custody.”  [Source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/japanese-internment-banished-and-beyond-tears-feature/)

*Canada is a proud, modern nation populated by persons from all over the world.
Our achievements inspire a vision of the future worthy of the sacrifices of the past.*

**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

Police reported 1,409 hate crimes in Canada in 2016, 47 more than in 2015.The 3% increase in hate crimes was a result of more incidents targeting South Asians and Arabs or West Asians, the Jewish population, and people based on their sexual orientation. [Source](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171128/dq171128d-eng.htm)
The TRC has documented the deaths of over 6,000 residential school students as a result of their school experience, adding that there are probably more. 
Odds of a student dying over the life of the program: 1 in 25 (if 6,000).
Odds of dying for Canadians serving in the Second World War: 1 in 26. [Source](http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-by-the-numbers-1.3096185)

*Nellie McClung: I’m a believer in women, in their ability to do things and in their influence and power. Women set the standards for the world, and it is for us, women in Canada, to set the standard high.*

**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**

On average, every six days a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. Aboriginal women in Canada are five times more likely than other women of the same age to die as the result of violence. The majority of victims of spousal violence continue to be females, accounting for 83% of victims.

As of March 31, 2010, there were 582 known cases of missing or murdered Aboriginal women in Canada. [Source](http://www.bwss.org/resources/information-on-abuse/numbers-are-people-too/)
