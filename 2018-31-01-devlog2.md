# Devlog #2:

- Thinking about exploding the "official" lightshow narrative and reconstituting it into statistics that represent the "reality" of what Canadian life is like. 
- Thinking of titling it something like "The (Un)Official Canadian Reality".
- Talked to Shawn about using that explodey program thing to explode the narrative and then figure out a way to reshape it into something else. Something like a series of videos to play in sequence, performance like. 
- Forked a-physical-book from **lizzy** and then cloned it onto my Github Desktop. We will see how that works: will investigate tomorrow. 
- Have been looking into the files from a-physical-book: I have managed to play around with the live demo but have to totally figure out where in the files I am to post my own data: I am worried about breaking whatever code/program is hidden there. Will remember to ask about it in class so I can start working on figuring out how to do this series of videos. 

## Oral Report Prompts:

Oral Report 1: cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?

- Cracks in the system: how to actually manage to project this where I want IE: parliament hill. 
- How has it been used? Projection mapping is used everywhere in Ottawa (**NB:** Parliament hill!). Would like to be using the same medium/method as the narrative I am "subverting". Using projection mapping to undermine projection mapping. 
- Affordances and edges? Visual: can be visceral and symbolic: IE: literally exploding/deconstructing the official narrative. Edges: Do I want to also incorporate sound? is this more difficult? Should it be just text? Image based? Linear? Jumbled?
- I think it resonates with the history/story I want to tell because it will concretize the effacing of historical narratives. I think that using "light" to shed light on the dark side of Canadian history is also symbolic and meaninful. 
- What do I need to find out? What to include in the narrative? Do I want all the official text first and then the counter narrative? should it be parcelled out?
