# Devlog #2:

- Thinking about exploding the "official" lightshow narrative and reconstituting it into statistics that represent the "reality" of what Canadian life is like. 
- Thinking of titling it something like "The (Un)Official Canadian Reality".
- Talked to Shawn about using that explodey program thing to explode the narrative and then figure out a way to reshape it into something else. Something like a series of videos to play in sequence, performance like. 
- Forked a-physical-book from **lizzy** and then cloned it onto my Github Desktop. We will see how that works: will investigate tomorrow. 
- Have been looking into the files from a-physical-book: I have managed to play around with the live demo but have to totally figure out where in the files I am to post my own data: I am worried about breaking whatever code/program is hidden there. Will remember to ask about it in class so I can start working on figuring out how to do this series of videos. 

**Feb. 1st** : Installing node.js (apparently this should help me with a-physical-book?)
This package has installed:
	•	Node.js v8.9.4 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v5.6.0 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH. **WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!** I will investigate. 

## Oral Report Prompts:

Oral Report 1: cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?

- Cracks in the system: how to actually manage to project this where I want IE: parliament hill. 
- How has it been used? Projection mapping is used everywhere in Ottawa (**NB:** Parliament hill!). Would like to be using the same medium/method as the narrative I am "subverting". Using projection mapping to undermine projection mapping. 
- Affordances and edges? Visual: can be visceral and symbolic: IE: literally exploding/deconstructing the official narrative. Edges: Do I want to also incorporate sound? is this more difficult? Should it be just text? Image based? Linear? Jumbled? **Performance aspect** 
- I think it resonates with the history/story I want to tell because it will concretize the effacing of historical narratives. I think that using "light" to shed light on the dark side of Canadian history is also symbolic and meaninful. 
- What do I need to find out? What to include in the narrative? Do I want all the official text first and then the counter narrative? should it be parcelled out? How much text to explode in each chunk? What is most visually effective/gives people enough time to read the text?

## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*
**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*
**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

*French culture flourished all across Canada.*
**Something about French discrimination?**

*In the War of 1812, English and French speaking farmers in Upper and Lower Canada took up arms alongside British regulars. Hundreds of black men, who had fled north to escape slavery, fought the American invasions of the Canadas. Ten thousand First Nations warriors helped seal the victory.*
**First Nations contribution to war as allies not as subjects: what they expected in return**

*Canada has always meant land. It has meant strength, freedom and pride of place under great northern skies.*
**Quote about indigenous tie to land:landed citizenship** 

*A modern nation rooted in collaboration emerged, from sea, to sea, to sea. Canada.*

*There is something in the Canadian spirit which craves a quest.*
*Quests are real and imagined voyages of discovery.*
**Quests for belonging on part of immigrants? (Maybe a quote by Anna Jameson/Catherine Parr Traill)** 

*We tied Canada together with two ribbons of steel.*
**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*
**Japanese internment/displacement** 

*Canada is a proud, modern nation populated by persons from all over the world.
Our achievements inspire a vision of the future worthy of the sacrifices of the past.*
**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

*Nellie McClung: I’m a believer in women, in their ability to do things and in their influence and power. Women set the standards for the world, and it is for us, women in Canada, to set the standard high.*
**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**


### Everyone's oral report:
Christina: history of Lebreton Flats. Empty land vs development. NCC appropriation. Projecting paintings to "refill" the land. 
Kira: Unspoken Ottawa. Look at Ottawa institutions such as orphan's homes or homes for the incurables. Blend fiction and history. History of madness. 
Nathalie: projection mapping: often used by institutions of dominance. Restoring old chinatown.
