## Command Line Tutorial
- Working on the command line. Going well. Finding it hard to decipher what everything means and tend to get confused as to the difference between "shell" and "directory". 
- When navigating through files, important to remember to use cd -- to start over if you get lost, and to think of files as "trees"
- you can basically do anything on your computer without leaving the command line! **Neat!**
- you can also use the arrows to move through the "history" of your commands.

**Using VIM (txt editor)**:

Ctrl+F (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page

Ctrl+B will move you up a page.

If you want to rapidly move to the end of a line, you can press: $ and to move to the start of one, 0. You can also move between sentences by typing ) (forward) or ( (backwards). For paragraphs, use } and {. Since you are doing everything with your keyboard, rather than having to hold your arrow key down to move around a document, this lets you zip quickly back and forth.

**Other commands**:
cp is copy. mv is move.
The ./ command refers to the current directory you’re in. This is a really valuable command. *helps you find your place!*
 Some of our other favourites are du, which is a way to find out how much memory is being used (du -h makes it human readable — as with other commands). For those of you on OS X, top provides an overview of what processes are running and touch FILENAME can create a basic text file 
 cat *	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for * , but can also be used to combine files.

## Markdown Tutorial
- Stackedit is a useful place to practice doing MD. I'm already pretty good at it tho. 
-  Since Markdown does not distinguish between fonts, we represent code by wrapping snippets in back-tick characters like "`"` For example, `<br />`. 
- Images can be referenced using !, followed by some alt-text in square brackets, followed by the image URL and an optional title. These will not be displayed in your plain text document, but would be embedded into a rendered HTML page.

Tables/that kinda thing:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|
| Row 2, column 1 | Row 2, column 2 | Row 2, column 3|
| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|


## Pandoc Tutorial

- Installing Pandoc itself proves to be a damn nightmare. Finalement, I manage it!
- OMG MY TEXT EDIT WASNT NATURALLY IN PLAIN TEXT SO THAT SET ME BACK. Ok this is a nightmare, nothing is working. 
I'm going to try and come back to this. [PandocMarkdownTips/Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

## Version Control Tutorial:
- Ok this makes sense to me: I already essentially do this on github with a lot of my own notes.
- I hate all of this. My head hurts a lot.
- So far can't figure out if github desktop is supposed to allow me to do local changes, as I am only managing the remote ones and then pushing them to desktop. *sigh*

# Devlog #2:

- Thinking about exploding the "official" lightshow narrative and reconstituting it into statistics that represent the "reality" of what Canadian life is like. 
- Thinking of titling it something like "The (Un)Official Canadian Reality".
- Talked to Shawn about using that explodey program thing to explode the narrative and then figure out a way to reshape it into something else. Something like a series of videos to play in sequence, performance like. 
- Forked a-physical-book from **lizzy** and then cloned it onto my Github Desktop. We will see how that works: will investigate tomorrow. 

## Oral Report Prompts:

Oral Report 1: cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?

- Cracks in the system: how to actually manage to project this where I want IE: parliament hill. 
- How has it been used? Projection mapping is used everywhere in Ottawa (**NB:** Parliament hill!). Would like to be using the same medium/method as the narrative I am "subverting". Using projection mapping to undermine projection mapping. 
- Affordances and edges? Visual: can be visceral and symbolic: IE: literally exploding/deconstructing the official narrative. Edges: Do I want to also incorporate sound? is this more difficult? Should it be just text? Image based? Linear? Jumbled?
- I think it resonates with the history/story I want to tell because it will concretize the effacing of historical narratives. I think that using "light" to shed light on the dark side of Canadian history is also symbolic and meaninful. 
- What do I need to find out? What to include in the narrative? Do I want all the official text first and then the counter narrative? should it be parcelled out?
