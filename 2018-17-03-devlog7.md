# Devlog 7

I am still plugging away at my Twine assignment for Brian's class: so far my non-linear interactive essay on Walden and Walden:A Game is over 11000 words that include 200 entries and over 300 links! This is super exciting and I really like the way in which my essay/interactive component will in a sense mimic the game and the manner in which Thoreau and the game demand a willingness to get lost in nature/the game. 

My project for this weekend is to work on using MapMap with my two screens at home, to get a sense for how it will work. I am also considering plugging my computer into my own projector to see how that works.

## Thoughts on Paradata:
I had a chat with Cristina about what paradata meant: we came to the conclusion that it was the theory/reasoning and methods behind our project and "making". Ok. I have discussed this before, but I feel that the whole notion of exploding the written word and discombobulating the status quo are at the core of my project, and I like the way that it manages to engage with the intersection of history and english disciplines' fascination with the written word/narrative. 
As far as the methods: as I have been documenting I used the live demo of a physical book to explode my chosen texts. Then I used Screencast omatic to record those clips, edit them to slow them down, and then used Imovie to reverse the clips. Next came uploading all those clips as paints into MapMap. I feel that the idea of using projection mapping is also integral to my project, as I like the idea of *shedding light* on the bias of national narratives.
